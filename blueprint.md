# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This document outlines the design and features of the web application.

## Implemented Features
- Initial setup for a framework-less web project.
- **Coin Flip Feature:** Transformed the previous betting mechanism into an interactive coin flip game.
    - Replaced "Up/Down" buttons with a clickable 3D animated coin.
    - Implemented client-side coin flip logic with random outcome (Heads/Tails).
    - Integrated CSS for coin styling, 3D flip animation, and result display.
    - Updated balance tracking and history based on coin flip results.

## Current Task: Implement Coin Flip Feature
### Plan
1. Create `blueprint.md` if it doesn't exist and add this section.
2. Modify `index.html` to include a coin container and a result display.
3. Add CSS in `style.css` for coin styling and flip animation.
4. Implement JavaScript in `main.js` for coin flip logic, image handling, event listeners, and result updates.
