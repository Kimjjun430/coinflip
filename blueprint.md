# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This document outlines the design and features of the web application.

## Implemented Features
- Initial setup for a framework-less web project.
- **Coin Flip Feature:** Transformed the previous betting mechanism into an interactive coin flip game.
    - Replaced "Up/Down" buttons with a clickable 3D animated coin.
    - Implemented client-side coin flip logic with random outcome (Heads/Tails).
    - Integrated CSS for coin styling, 3D flip animation, and result display.
    - Updated balance tracking and history based on coin flip results.
- **Enhanced Coin Flip Animation and Images:**
    - Sourced widely available coin images for heads and tails (Wikimedia Commons).
    - Modified `style.css` to use these images and updated the `@keyframes coin-flip` for a more dynamic animation, including increased rotations, vertical movement, and scaling during the flip.
    - Adjusted `main.js`'s `setTimeout` duration to synchronize with the new animation.

## Current Task: None
